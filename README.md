### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a seasoned software engineer and engineering manager.  I currently working on:
- refactoring and migrating legacy Java monoliths to cloud-native micro-services
- enjoying productivity benefits of Kotlin development
- always looking to learn cool things
- managing operations and devops using tools like AWS CloudFormation and bash
- reach out to me on twitter at @java1337
